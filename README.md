# lcd_hack

Quick app to use the LCD display that is included with the Recon Sentinel (https://hackaday.com/2020/11/16/teardown-recon-sentinel/) devices, viz a Rock64v2 connected over GPIO IÂ²C port expander (using a PCF8574) to a Hitachi HD44780 controller.

See https://github.com/dhylands/python_lcd#custom-characters for indentifying which character sets are supported.


## Installing

If installing/working with a source checkout issue:

    sudo apt install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    sudo pip3 install smbus2
    # or use virtualenv/venv (or local env)

See https://github.com/dbrgn/RPLCD for detailed install instructions.

See https://clach04.github.io/lcdchargen/ for custom character generator that emits Python (as well as C code), source code available from https://github.com/clach04/lcdchargen/tree/python
